    Hi there! My name is James. At a young age, I started messing with rewiring electronics, boobytrapping my door with industrial flash units to blind trespassers, and hacking games in basic to do my bidding. Hacking electronics has always been my true love, next to programming.
    After working for the local newspaper as a photo monkey for years, I noticed that I had much more to offer than they were willing to tell me to do, so I just did it. In less than a year I was their webmaster, and began creating intranet software to manage their grossly inadequate filing schemes and content upload techniques. One Halloween I dressed up as a ninja and the moniker Tech Ninja was born.
    I realize I am not the only one of the guild of Tech Ninjas.. I am one of many, I have a number. Since we ninja's are pretty sly and secretive, the ninja-numbering is never usually discussed, so I can only take a good guess that I'm probably not number 41...
